# Horiseon-Code-Refactor
## Horiseon Code Refactor: Week 1 Challenge

## Summary of Task
This week my Challenge was an "on-the-job ticket" where I had starter code from a Marketing Agency's web page that I needed to modify. 

This entailed the process of **"Refactoring"**: In computer programming, code refactoring is the process of restructuring existing code&mdash;without changing its external behavior&mdash;to improve the design, structure, or implementation of the application, while preserving its functionality.

Below are the following Challenge requirements according to the **User Story** & **Acceptance Criteria**

## User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```
## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```

*In addition to following these requirements and the grading criteria, I was also mindful to check that all links were functioning correctly; consolidate the selectors and properties, and organize them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements; and add comments with respect to modified elements or sections of the page.*

## Deploying to GitHub Pages
Along with the above requirements, I followed the instructions to create this project and deploy it to GitHub Pages. This included creating a new repository, cloning it to my computer, and using git commands to save and push my code to the GitHub repository. 

Finally, I deployed and published my project on the site so that my webpage is live! Hope you enjoyed reviewing my project!
